Project Exam: Build a Foodie Website

You have been tasked with creating a website called Good Food Mood which helps people to find recipes. The site is aimed at working people who are interested in eating healthy and interesting food, but don't have a lot of time to read recipe books. The site should feel fun and engaging for users and guide them to take action.
Deploy a WordPress site to a webhost and use it as a Headless CMS to manage an API for the food site. Add content to the WordPress site for the recipes. Note that the WordPress site is only for managing the API; the website you deliver must be written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Users should be able to search through a list of recipes to find one they are interested in.
